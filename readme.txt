********** ABOUT PHP PhotoD **********

PhotoD is a free simple photogallery, written in PHP, which requires no 
programing knowledge and no database. The PHP script is open source and
fully expandable.

These files are provided 'as is' and are for use at your own risk.

Feel free to use, edit, distribute and do whatever you want with this
script. I don't ask anything but credit where due is always nice :)


********** INSTALLATION GUIDE **********

   1. Unpack the PhotoD files to a new folder on your server.
      e.g. '/var/www/photod/'

   2. Upload your images and thumbnails to the gallery sub-folders
      e.g. '/var/www/photod/gallery/images/' and '/var/www/photod/gallery/thumbs/'

   3. You're done!
      The site title, meta and other information can be changed by editing your index.php file.


********** USAGE GUIDE **********

To function correctly images must have a 'full size' and a 'thumbnail' version.
   Place full size images in the directory 'photod/gallery/images/'
   Place thumbnails into 'photod/gallery/thumbs/'.
   Thumbnails and full size images must have the same filename.

To work well with the supplied theme, images should have the following dimensions :
   Full Size Image :: w - 728px h - 450px (height is not strict)
   Thumbnail Image :: w - 200px h - 160px

Images are sorted in reverse alphabetical order (z to a).
   A handy naming convention might be numerical dates,
   e.g. 16052009-2.jpg, 16052009-1.jpg, 13052009-2.jpg, 130520091-1.jpg
